# My ESP8266 + Plantower AQ Sensor Project 3D printed case

This is the 3D printed case for the project.  I checked in all of the STL files
for the case, so you should be able to just print them directly.  I made two
versions of the case, one with most of the electronics exposed (because I think
it looks neat), and one where the electronics are covered but there are some
holes to let air flow.  The one with holes is more targeted toward outdoor
installations, but obviously it's not totally weatherproof.

Both cases come in two parts, `top.stl` and `bottom.stl` are the files for the
"electronics exposed" version.  `top-with-lid.stl` and `bottom-with-lid.stl`
are for the other version.

These STL files are generated using OpenSCAD and the source file is
`case.scad`.  Feel free to mess around with it and customize the case!  For
example maybe try changing "TendAir" to some other text. lol
